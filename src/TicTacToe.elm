   Walkthrough:
      1. implement 'playerToString'
      2. cells must be a Maybe Player
      3. Add a new Msg for the user to click on a Cell
      4. When user clicks on a cell, set that cell to current player
      5. When the user clicks on a cell, we must change the next player
      6. Only empty cells must be clickable
      7. determine endgame:
        1. write a function "isTris" to determine if three given index contains the same player
        2. write a function "isTie" to determine if all cells are filled in but no one won
        3. write a function "updateGameStatus" to update the game status
      8. Add a button to start a new game
      9. When a user wins, change the winning cells background color to red
